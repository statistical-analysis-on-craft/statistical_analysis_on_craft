The C_codes file consists two files: Independence_Section3 and Experiment_Section4.
Section 3 conduct a experiment to verify the independence between two statistical variables;
Section4 show experiment resluts. We only display one experiment code, and the experimental codes 
under other conditions only needs to modify the data complexity and threshold value.

The Matleb file consist one file: Theoretical calculation.
We use the tool Matlab to compute the theoretical value of success probability on the
three models. Meanwhile, the figures in paper are obtained by the tool Matlab.
