The C_codes file consists two files: Independence_Section3 and Experiment_Section4.
Section III conduct a experiment to verify the independence between two statistical variables;
Section IV show experiment resluts. We only display one experiment code of every Model, and the experimental codes 
under other conditions only needs to modify the data complexity and threshold value.

The Matleb file consist two files: Section_experiment and Section_comparsion.
We use the tool Matlab to compute the theoretical value of success probability on the three models. 
Meanwhile, the Figure 1,2,3,4 are got by codes and the Figure.5,6,7 in paper are obtained by the tool Matlab in Section_experiment .
In addition, the intersection of the probability density functions of two random variables and the success probability about this intersection are calculated by the tool Matlab in Section_comparsion.
